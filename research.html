                        genetic SNP
                        data inputs. Built on PyTorch, GeoGenIE is specifically
                        optimized to
                        account for geographic sampling bias and the limited
                        number of SNPs
                        typically found in GT-seq panels. This software is a
                        powerful
                        resource for researchers who need to infer geographic
                        origins from
                        genetic data, providing a robust framework for handling
                        complex

                    <h3>SNPio: Object-Oriented Python API for Popultion Genomic
                        Data
                        Filtering, Visualization, and File Conversion</h3>
                    <p>SNPio is a cutting-edge software project aimed at
                        creating a
                        user-friendly, object-oriented Python API designed for
                        reading,
                        filtering, and converting various standard genomic data
                        file
                        formats. In the complex field of genomics, researchers
                        often face
                        challenges when dealing with diverse data formats and
                        the need for
                        efficient data manipulation tools. SNPio addresses these
                        challenges
                        by providing a streamlined interface that simplifies the
                        management
                        of genomic datasets, enabling users to focus on analysis
                        rather than
                        data handling.</p>
                    <p>This software is particularly valuable because it brings
                        together a
                        wide range of functionalities within a single framework,
                        making it
                        easier for researchers to process and analyze genomic
                        data. With
                        SNPio, tasks like filtering large SNP datasets,
                        converting between
                        formats (e.g., VCF, STRUCTURE, PHYLIP), and integrating
                        data
                        from different
                        sources are made straightforward and accessible, even to
                        those with
                        limited programming experience. Ongoing development
                        efforts include
                        expanding the APIâ€™s capabilities to support additional
                        file formats,
                        enhancing performance, calculating summary statistics ad
                        visualization, and integrating SNPio with
                        popular
                        bioinformatics tools and pipelines.</p>

                    <h3>Genomic SNP Imputation using AI (PG-SUI)</h3>
                    <p>One of my key research projects is the development of
                        PG-SUI (Population Genomics - Supervised and
                        Unsupervised Imputation), an AI-based framework for
                        imputing missing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
                        data in genomic datasets. Missing data is a common issue
                        in population genomics, often leading to biased results
                        and reduced statistical power. PG-SUI addresses this
                        challenge by employing both supervised and unsupervised
                        machine learning models in a user-friendly manner to
                        accurately predict missing
                        SNPs based on non-linear patterns observed in the
                        existing data.
                    </p>
                    <p>This project is particularly significant because it not
                        only enhances the accuracy of population genomic studies
                        but also enables researchers to utilize incomplete
                        datasets - a commonplace issue in population genetics -
                        more effectively. By reducing the need for
                        extensive data collection, PG-SUI accelerates research
                        timelines and lowers costs, making genomic studies more
                        accessible to a broader range of scientists. Ongoing
                        work involves refining the existing models to handle a
                        wider
                        variety of data types, adding new models, and
                        integrating the framework into
                        commonly used bioinformatics pipelines.</p>

                    <h3>Species Delimitation using Machine Learning (SuperDeli)
                    </h3>
                    <p>Another current focus of my research is the application
                        of
                        machine learning techniques to species delimitationâ€”a
                        process crucial for understanding biodiversity,
                        conservation, and evolutionary biology. Traditional
                        methods of species delimitation often rely on subjective
                        interpretations of morphological and genetic data,
                        leading to inconsistent results. By incorporating
                        machine learning, my approach provides a more objective
                        and reproducible framework for defining species
                        boundaries.</p>
                    <p>The machine learning models I develop for species
                        delimitation take into account both genetic and
                        ecological data, allowing for a comprehensive analysis
                        that considers multiple factors influencing species
                        differentiation. This approach is particularly useful in
                        cases where species exhibit subtle morphological
                        differences or where hybridization complicates the
                        identification of distinct species. My work in this area
                        aims to create tools that are not only scientifically
                        rigorous but also user-friendly, so they can be widely
                        adopted by researchers in various fields of biology.</p>

                    <h3>Evolutionary Dynamics of Hybrid Zones</h3>
                    <p>Hybrid zonesâ€”regions where distinct species
                        interbreedâ€”are natural laboratories for studying
                        evolutionary processes. My research in this area focuses
                        on understanding the genetic and environmental factors
                        that drive hybridization and the formation of new
                        species. By combining field data with genomic analyses,
                        I investigate how hybrid zones contribute to
                        biodiversity and the evolution of new species. This
                        research has significant implications for conservation
                        biology, particularly in understanding how human
                        activities influence hybridization and species
                        integrity.</p>

                    <h3>Collaborations and Future Directions</h3>
                    <p>My work is highly collaborative, involving partnerships
                        with
                        researchers in ecology, evolutionary biology, and
                        computational and data science. These collaborations
                        allow me to
                        apply cutting-edge computational methods to a wide range
                        of
                        biological questions, from the dynamics of disease
                        resistance in wildlife populations to the genomic
                        underpinnings of speciation. Looking forward, I aim to
                        expand my research to include more interdisciplinary
                        projects that integrate ecological modeling, climate
                        change
                        predictions, and conservation strategies.</p>
                    <p>In the future, I plan to continue advancing the use of AI
                        and
                        machine learning in genomics, with a particular focus on
                        making these tools more accessible to non-experts. This
                        involves not only developing more intuitive software and
                        user interfaces but also providing training and
                        resources to
                        help researchers apply these techniques to their own
                        work.
