                    <h3>Genomic SNP Data Imputation using AI (PG-SUI)</h3>
                    <p>One of my key research projects is the development of
                        PG-SUI (Population Genomics - Supervised and
                        Unsupervised Imputation), an AI-based framework for
                        imputing missing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
                        data in genomic datasets. Missing data is a common issue
                        in population genomics, often leading to biased results
                        and reduced statistical power. PG-SUI addresses this
                        challenge by employing both supervised and unsupervised
                        machine learning models to accurately predict missing
                        SNPs based on patterns observed in the existing data.
                    </p>
                    <p>This project is particularly significant because it not
                        only enhances the accuracy of population genomic studies
                        but also enables researchers to utilize incomplete
                        datasets more effectively. By reducing the need for
                        extensive data collection, PG-SUI accelerates research
                        timelines and lowers costs, making genomic studies more
                        accessible to a broader range of scientists. Ongoing
                        work involves refining the models to handle a wider
                        variety of data types and integrating the framework into
                        commonly used bioinformatics pipelines.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Species Delimitation using Machine Learning</h3>
                    <p>Another major focus of my research is the application of
                        machine learning techniques to species delimitation—a
                        process crucial for understanding biodiversity,
                        conservation, and evolutionary biology. Traditional
                        methods of species delimitation often rely on subjective
                        interpretations of morphological and genetic data,
                        leading to inconsistent results. By incorporating
                        machine learning, my approach provides a more objective
                        and reproducible framework for defining species
                        boundaries.</p>
                    <p>The machine learning models I develop for species
                        delimitation take into account both genetic and
                        ecological data, allowing for a comprehensive analysis
                        that considers multiple factors influencing species
                        differentiation. This approach is particularly useful in
                        cases where species exhibit subtle morphological
                        differences or where hybridization complicates the
                        identification of distinct species. My work in this area
                        aims to create tools that are not only scientifically
                        rigorous but also user-friendly, so they can be widely
                        adopted by researchers in various fields of biology.</p>

                    <h3>Evolutionary Dynamics of Hybrid Zones</h3>
                    <p>Hybrid zones—regions where distinct species
                        interbreed—are natural laboratories for studying
                        evolutionary processes. My research in this area focuses
                        on understanding the genetic and environmental factors
                        that drive hybridization and the formation of new
                        species. By combining field data with genomic analyses,
                        I investigate how hybrid zones contribute to
                        biodiversity and the evolution of new species. This
                        research has significant implications for conservation
                        biology, particularly in understanding how human
                        activities influence hybridization and species
                        integrity.</p>

                <h3>Ongoing Collaborations and Future Directions</h3>
                <p>My work is highly collaborative, involving partnerships with
                    researchers in ecology, evolutionary biology, and
                    computational science. These collaborations allow me to
                    apply cutting-edge computational methods to a wide range of
                    biological questions, from the dynamics of disease
                    resistance in wildlife populations to the genomic
                    underpinnings of speciation. Looking forward, I aim to
                    expand my research to include more interdisciplinary
                    projects that integrate ecological modeling, climate change
                    predictions, and conservation strategies.</p>
                <p>In the future, I plan to continue advancing the use of AI and
                    machine learning in genomics, with a particular focus on
                    making these tools more accessible to non-experts. This
                    involves not only developing more intuitive software and
                    user interfaces but also providing training and resources to
                    help researchers apply these techniques to their own work.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Overall, my research is driven by a passion for understanding
                    the complexities of life through the lens of genomics and
                    computational biology. Whether through developing innovative
                    tools like PG-SUI, advancing species delimitation
                    techniques, or exploring the evolutionary dynamics of hybrid
                    zones, my goal is to contribute to the scientific
                    community's ability to study and conserve the natural world
                    in an era of rapid environmental change.</p>
